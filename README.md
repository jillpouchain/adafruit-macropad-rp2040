# adafruit-macropad-rp2040
Welcome to my repo for the Adafruit MacroPad RP2040.

Here you will find Arduino/CircuitPython files and projects I used with the macropad.
Some of them are to getting used to it/learn how to use it, and others will be for personnal use (but happy to share!). I'll try to comment as much as possible and link sources when I was inspired by others.

## Projects
### macropad-demo

This is the basic demo file. Here is what it'll do:
The NeoPixel LEDs light up in a rainbow. Try pressing each key to see a message on the display, and the corresponding pixel turn white. Rotate the rotary encoder to see the value change on the display. Press the rotary encoder to see the NeoPixels get brighter. If you have an I2C device attached via the STEMMA QT port, you'll see the address printed as well.
